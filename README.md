# Nexus Aurora Web Platform

Nexus Aurora is an Open Source Project aiming for opening up the barrier of Space Colonisation. Together, professionals from around the globe team up from different areas of expertise - be it logistics, economy, 3d design, or **web development**. This is where we come in. This is Nexus Aurora’s official repository for our whole stack of web applications. Some of these include our Homepage, a 3d Assets Display, and a Social Media App for Martians!

With your help, we can Colonise Space. And it’s all based on this. The Nexus Aurora Platform. 

Convinced? Let’s get started!

<hr/>

## Tech stack
The tech stack for the Nexus Aurora Platform is the following: `React Native` + `Typescript` + `Rxjs` + `Redux` + `Node.js` + `Mongodb` + `Mongoose`. If you’ve done much with `npm`, you’ll know that **you *don’t* have to go through the installation process of each and every one of these**. Follow the installation steps for more. 


<hr/>

## Installation
**First, ensure you have [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [`mongodb`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) installed**. These are important because they are the foundation of our tech stack. To use an `Android` or `iOS` emulator, you will need one to be installed. We recommend Android Studio and XCode for this, respectively. 

Now that we’re sure you have the initial prerequisites, we can get to the easy part. 

Clone the repository, ```git clone https://github.com/Nexus-Aurora/na-platform.git```

Enter it, ```cd na-platform```

And install everything else! ```npm install```

And you’re ready!

<hr/>

## Start
To start, run 
* `mongod` to start the database (if you’re on Linux or MacOS mongo boots on OS start so you can skip this step)
* `npm run server` - Run the NodeJS Mongo server
* `npm run web` - Run the frontend app for web
* `npm run android` - Run the frontend app for Android Simulators
* `npm run ios` - Run the frontend app for iOS Emulators

And you’re up and running!
